title:  "Develop custom Ansible modules"

One thing that I really think is neat with Ansible is that when you need functionality that are not part of the Ansible core (let's say you need to integrate Ansible with bigip F5 load balancer) you can just turn to Python (or any other language for that matter) to write your own modules that you later can use in the regular playbooks. This is a really neat functionality, you are not tied down to the dsl (such as in the case of Puppet). DSL:s are in my experience very limited and stupid; you would rather want turn to a real general purpose programming language.

Here are some basic considerations of writing Ansible modules:

* Ansible will look in the library directory relative to the playbook, for example: `playbooks/library/your-module`
* You can also specify the path to your custom modules in ansible.cfg, for example: `library = /usr/share/ansible`
* Ansible expects modules to return JSON, for example: `{'changed': false, 'failed': true, 'msg': 'could not reach the host'}`
* If you write your module in Python (it can be written in any language as long as it returns json) you can import Ansible helper libraries
* If are using Python try to limit the libraries you are using to the standard library. If that's not possible you need a strategy to install those libraries everywhere you will run the playbooks (preferably with your Linux distributions package manager and not pip ;) )
* Good practice is to write a multi-line at the start of your module describing parameters and how to run it. This is especially important if you want to open source it.

# A trivial example

Let's say we would want to write a custom module that will check if a program is running on the target host. From our playbook we will call it like this: `is_running: name=consul`

While this is a very trivial example (you would surely not need to write a custom module for this since it's supported in ansible core) this will give you the needed boilerplate code needed to write a custom module, just re-implement that and focus on the real business logic you want to solve.
